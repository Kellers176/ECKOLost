# ECKOLost
Game my production team made during our second year at Champlain College. I was one of two programmers on the team along with three designers, one artist, and one producer.

ECKO LOST is a single-player grid-based puzzle game where the player takes a blind newborn baby alien who is trying to get back to his mother. He does so by solving puzzles in order to move through rooms of a spaceship and get back to her. Along the way, he will have the help of the ship's AI that will guide him to his goal. The game uses voice recognition to move the character and identify objects that are in the room using the alien baby's echolocation. It is a slow-paced game with relaxing game play. People that enjoy science fiction themes and text based adventure games will like Echo Lost. The art coincides with a Sci-fi theme while slowly becoming more and more detailed as levels go on to reveal story elements. Though the main character will remain adorable in nature, the background contrasts it with darker tones and colder colors. It is meant to appeal to teenagers and young adults between the ages of 15-30.
